<p>
    In this class, I hope to become more comfortable with JavaScript, become better at html,
    and generally learn the importance of using a framework when implementing web applications into businesses.
    I also want to learn how to balance trying to figure things out on my own and using my resources for help
    so I can maximize my learning while still using my time wisely.
